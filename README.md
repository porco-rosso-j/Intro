I'm Porco, a solo solidity dev whose main interests are around DeFi, ZKP, and Account Abstraction.   
Tech Stacks: Solidity, NodeJS, Typescript, React, and Noir.

## Projects 

- [SafeRecover](https://github.com/porco-rosso-j/safe-recovery-noir): A Safe module used for recovering ownership of Safe account with various zk-powered recovery methods, such as private backup address, zkTouchID, social recovery with private guardians, and secret word. The product is still under development as [one of the Safe Grant Wave I grantees](https://safe.mirror.xyz/dM9OXAQe_700TbCMqyi7K2facdaLYvfCh3Th1jCb7hg).
